## Task 1: Local repository

For task 1, you will open up your command line (preferably VS Code) and complete the following:
- [ ] Create a directory using the command ```mkdir```
- [ ] In the directory you created initialize Git using ```git init```
- [ ] Create a README.md file in your directory using the ```echo $null >> filename``` command
- [ ] Make sure README.md is in your Working Directory by checking your status with ```git status```
- [ ] Open your README.md file in VS Code and add your name as a level 2 heading (remember to save your file)
- [ ] Move README.md from the Working Directory to the Staging Area by using ```git add```
- [ ] Make sure README.md is in your Staging Area by checking your status with ```git status```
- [ ] Commit README.md to your repository using ```git commit```
- [ ] Make sure your Working Directory and Staging Area are clean with ```git status```
- [ ] Make sure your commit has been logged into your repository by using ```git log```

Take a screenshot of your command line, with the steps above, and upload your screenshot to a new Issue titled Task 1. In the body of the issue you can drag and drop your screenshot or search for it on your device. Once you have added the screenshot you can submit the issue and move to the next task.

_If you are unsure of the process, have a look at https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue_



## Task 2: Remote repository on GitHub

For task 2, you will have to do the following:
- [ ] In GitHub in this repository, you need to find the repository URL in the root of the repository. You should see a button that says ```Clone or Download```, copy the URL and head over to the command line.
- [ ] On the command line you want to type ```git clone <YOUR URL>``` where you add the URL in the place of ```<YOUR URL>```. You will notice that there is some network activity happening.
- [ ] Once the network activity finishes, type ```ls``` and you will notice you have the repository on your local machine. You can ```cd``` into the repository and see all the files that are on GitHub are now on your local machine.

Take a screenshot of your command line showing how you cloned this repository onto your local machine. Create an Issue with the title Task 2 and include the screenshot in the body of the issue.


## The end
This only scratched the surface of what is possible with Git and GitHub. With the courses you have to complete as the weekly task, you will learn a lot more on how to use Git and GitHub. Once you are comfortable with the command line, I would definitely encourage you to try [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com). It is a great GUI for performing these tasks.
